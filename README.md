# Visual_Novel_Engine
This is my first openGL project and it is still under development. 
I am still learning  openGL and will create a visual novel engine that allow us to create visual novel. As I learn more about OpenGL, the project will progress :) 


I am currently following OpenGL tutorials from Cherno https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2
and will adjust it to my needs for a visual novel engine


I'm keeping everything 3d so when I need something in 3d, i won't need to change the whole code.
